	\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Education}
	
	A school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:\\
	\vspace{.5cm}
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=38, lastline=39]{PS01_answersIF.R}  
	
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find a 90\% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.\\
		
		  \begin{verbatim}
		  # calculate sample statistics
      # capture the number of observations 
      n <- length(iqData)

      # calculate mean
      iqSum <- sum(iqData)           # sum of IQ scores
      iqMean <-iqSum / n             # mean IQ score for sample

      # calculate variance and standard deviation
      iqVar <- sum((iqData - iqMean)^2)/(n-1) 
      iqSD <-sqrt(iqVar)            
      
		  \end{verbatim}
      
      The code for the t-test at 90\% is:
      
      \begin{verbatim}
      t.val <- qt(alphaVal/2, df = n-1, lower.tail = FALSE)

      CI_lower <- iqMean - t.val * iqse 
      CI_upper <- iqMean + t.val * iqse 

      \end{verbatim}
      The result was:
      
      Our Confidence interval for the IQ of the students in the sample is: 
       
       $93.96 <$ mean IQ $< 102.92$ 
       
       with a confidence level of 90\%.
       \footnote{A Z-test gave a  90\% CI of $94.13 < \mu < 102.75$.}
      
      
		\item Next, the school counselor was curious  whether  the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.\\ 
		\noindent Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with $\alpha=0.05$.
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		    \item The number of observations is 25, which isn't ideal for t-test statistics
		    (we would prefer at least 30 observations).  The data isn't random, as all are students from the same school.
		    
		    \item H$_0$: the average IQ score in the sample is less than the population average
		    ie $\mu_O \le \mu$
		    \item H$\alpha$: the average iq score in the sample is greater than the population average  ie $\mu_O > \mu$
		    \item Calculate test statistic  \[TS = \frac{\bar{Y}  - \mu_0 }{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}}\]
		    \item  Calculate p-value \[p = Pr( Z \le - |\frac{\bar{Y}  - \mu_O }{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}} |)\]
		    
		    \item if p $\le$ $\alpha=0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis
		    
		  \end{enumerate}
		  
		  \noindent

      \emph{Code}
		  \begin{verbatim} 

  		  # Test our hypothesis
        alphaVal <- 0.05
        popMean <- 100
        #get test statistic
        testStatistic <- (iqMean - popMean) / iqse
                  
        pValue <- pnorm(-abs(testStatistic))

        # calculate t-test p-value 
        t_pValue <- pt(abs(testStatistic), df = n-1, lower.tail = FALSE)


		  \end{verbatim} 

      \emph{Results}
		  p-value for normal distribution is 0.276

\begin{tabular}{r|r|r}
          t & df  & p-value\\
 -0.5957439 &24 &0.2784617\\
\end{tabular}
        The p-value is greater than 5\%, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis. 
        The data does not support the suggestion that the school IQ scores are greater than the 
        population average.




	\end{enumerate}
