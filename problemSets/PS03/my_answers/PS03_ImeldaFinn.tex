  \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=60, lastline=60]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}

\section*{Question 1}

\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A linear regression was run where the outcome variable was \texttt{voteshare} and 
		the explanatory variable was \texttt{difflog}.	
		  The function call to generate the model is:

	    \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=93, lastline=93]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}
	    The results are in Table~\ref{tab:vote_spend}. 

		\item The scatterplot of the two variables, with the regression line is in Figure~\ref{fig:vote_spend}. 	

		
		\item The residuals from the model were saved as a  separate object.	
	    \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=104, lastline=104]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}

		\item Prediction Equation 
		
    \[voteshare = 0.579031 + (0.041666) * difflog\]

    $voteshare$ is 0.579031 when $difflog$ is 0 and it increases by 0.041666 
    for each unit increase in $difflog$, ie the share of the vote received by the 
    incumbent increased when they outspent the challenger.  For example, if the difference between the incumbent's spending and the challengers spending is $0.57008707 (=x_1)$, the predicted voteshare for the incumbent is $\hat{y} = 0.579031 + (0.041666) * 0.57008707 = 0.6027842$; the difference between the actual value $(y_1)$ and $\hat{y}$, is $\epsilon_1 = -0.004228$.

\section*{Question 2}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference between incumbent and challenger's spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party are related.%\vspace{.25cm}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A linear regression was run where the outcome variable was  \texttt{presvote} and 
		the explanatory variable was \texttt{difflog}.	
		
      The function call to generate the model is:
	    \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=149, lastline=149]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}

      The results are in table~\ref{tab:pres_spend}
		
		\item Scatterplot of the two variables, with the regression line in Figure~\ref{fig:pres_spend}.
		
		\item The residuals from the model were saved as a  separate object.	
    	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=159, lastline=159]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}
		
		\item Prediction Equation 
     \[presvote = 0.507583 + (0.023837) * difflog\]

       \texttt{presvote} is 0.507583 when \texttt{difflog} is 0, and it increases by 0.023837 
       for each unit increase in \texttt{difflog} (ie the share of the vote received by 
       the incumbent's presidential candidate increased when the incumbent outspent the 
       challenger.)

\section*{Question 3}

\noindent We are interested in knowing how the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party is associated with the incumbent's electoral success.
	%\vspace{.25cm}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A linear regression was run where the outcome variable was \texttt{voteshare} and 
		  the explanatory variable was \texttt{presvote}.

      The function call to generate the model is:
  	  \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=204, lastline=204]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}
      and the results are in Table~\ref{tab:vote_pres}

		\item Scatterplot of the two variables, with the regression line in Figure~\ref{fig:vote_pres}.

		\item Prediction Equation 

     \[voteshare = 0.441330 + (0.388018) * presvote\]
     
     \texttt{voteshare} is 0.441330 when \texttt{presvote} is 0 and it increases
     by 0.388018 for each unit increase in \texttt{presvote}, ie the incumbent's share 
     of the vote increased when their presidential candidate received a higher
     share of the vote.

	\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 4}
\noindent The residuals from Question 1 tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{voteshare} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger. The residuals in Question 2 tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{presvote} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger in the district.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A linear regression was run where the outcome variable was the residuals from Question 1 
		and the explanatory variable was the residuals from Question 2.	
		
      The function call to generate the model is:
	    \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=258, lastline=259]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}

	    and the results are in Table~\ref{tab:residuals}.

		\item Scatterplot of the two sets of residuals, with the regression line in 
		Figure~\ref{fig:residuals}.

		\item Prediction Equation
	
	\[voteshare residuals  = -5.207e-18 + (0.2569) * presvote residuals\]
	
	  The \texttt{voteshare} residual value is 0 when \texttt{presvote} residual value is 0; 
	   it increases by 0.2569 for each unit increase in \texttt{presvote} residuals

  The value of the incumbent vote share not accounted for by the difference in incumbent spending increases by 0.2569 for each unit increase in the value of the factors which cause an increase in presidential vote share, excluding incumbent spending.

\section*{Question 5}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger? 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A linear regression was run where the outcome variable was \texttt{voteshare} and 
		the explanatory variables were \texttt{presvote} and \texttt{difflog}.	
		
      The function call to generate the model is:
	    \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=324, lastline=324]{PS03_ImeldaFinn.R}

	    The results of the linear model are in Table ~\ref{tab:vote_spend_pres}(1).

      The additional variables are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:add_var}.\footnote{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59150905/is-there-a-ggplot2-analogue-to-the-avplots-function-in-r}

\begin{comment}
	    \begin{figure}
		    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Graphics/add_variable.png}
		    \caption{Vote share as a function of differential spending and presidential vote share}
		    \label{fig:add_var}
	    \end{figure}

\end{comment}

		\item Prediction Equation
  
      \[voteshare = 0.4486442 + (0.0355431) * difflog + (0.2568770) * presvote\]

      \texttt{voteshare} is 0.4486442 when \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote} are 0; 
        it increases by 0.0355431 for each unit increase in \texttt{difflog} 
        (holding \texttt{presvote} constant); 
        it increases by 0.2568770 for each unit increase in \texttt{presvote}
           (holding \texttt{difflog} constant).

		\item %What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
    The coefficient for residual presidential vote share in Q4 is the same as the coefficient for presidential vote share in Q5, ie 0.256877, ie the slope of the regression line in Figure~\ref{fig:residuals} is the same as the slope in the first graph in Figure~\ref{fig:add_var}.

    In model 5, the coefficient for \texttt{presvote} is a partial predictor, with \texttt{difflog} 
    held constant.  The residuals from model 2 represent the variation in the value of the presidential vote, excluding \texttt{difflog} (which was specifically accounted for as a predictor).  In both models, we are getting a predictive value for \texttt{voteshare} based on \texttt{presvote}, with \texttt{difflog} excluded/controlled.
